# 🧭 Confirmation Required: Batch Employee Onboarding Access

Hello **{{Manager Name}}**,

This message is to inform you that, as part of the current **organizational restructuring**, several employees under your supervision have been identified for **onboarding or role reassignment** within Moodle.

Before the training content can be assigned, we require your **confirmation** to ensure that each employee receives access to the correct onboarding materials — both **general company-wide modules** and **role-specific training** related to their new positions.
