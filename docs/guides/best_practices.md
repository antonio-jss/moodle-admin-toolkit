## 📋 1. General Administration Principles

| **Area** | **Best Practice** | **Why It Matters** |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------|
| Documentation | Keep detailed documentation of every configuration, plugin, and system change. | Facilitates troubleshooting, onboarding, and auditing. |
| Version Control | Track custom themes, language packs, and plugins in a Git repository. | Ensures reproducibility and change tracking. |
| Testing | Always test updates, themes, and plugins in a staging environment before production deployment. | Reduces risk of downtime or data corruption. |
| Automation | Automate backups, updates, and monitoring tasks through cron and scripts. | Saves time and reduces human error. |
| Communication | Maintain clear communication with teachers, managers, and IT teams. | Aligns platform management with organizational needs. |

## 🔐 2. Security Best Practices

| **Practice** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Use HTTPS | Enforce HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificates for all connections. |
| Keep Moodle Updated | Apply all Moodle core and plugin updates promptly after testing. |
| Strong Passwords & MFA | Enforce password policies and enable two-factor authentication for admins. |
| Limit Admin Accounts | Assign administrator privileges sparingly and review permissions quarterly. |
| Secure Server Access | Restrict SSH, SFTP, and DB access to trusted IPs; use key-based authentication. |
| Regular Security Audits | Perform vulnerability scans and Moodle security reports monthly. |
| Log Monitoring | Enable logs and review access logs for suspicious activity. |

## ⚙️ 3. Performance Optimization

| **Aspect** | **Recommendation** | **Notes** |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------|
| Caching | Enable and configure MUC (Moodle Universal Cache) and OPcache. | Improves site responsiveness. |
| Database Tuning | Optimize `innodb_buffer_pool_size` and `max_connections` according to traffic. | Use monitoring tools like `mysqltuner`. |
| Cron Jobs | Schedule `cron.php` every minute via system cron. | Keeps activities, enrollments, and notifications running smoothly. |
| File Storage | Store large backups and SCORM packages in external object storage (e.g., S3). | Reduces load on local disk. |
| Theme Optimization | Minimize use of heavy JS/CSS themes; enable caching and compression. | Faster page loading for users. |
| Load Balancing | Consider a separate DB server or CDN if user volume is high. | Improves scalability. |

---

## 🧩 4. Plugin Management

| **Step** | **Best Practice** | **Explanation** |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Selection | Only install plugins from trusted Moodle sources or verified developers. | Prevents security and compatibility issues. |
| Testing | Test all new plugins in a staging environment. | Identifies conflicts early. |
| Version Tracking | Record plugin versions and changelogs in `/docs/plugins_list.md`. | Facilitates audits and rollback. |
| Deactivation Policy | Disable unused or outdated plugins. | Reduces maintenance overhead. |
| Compatibility Checks | Check compatibility with your Moodle version before upgrading. | Avoids site errors and data loss. |

---

## 💾 5. Backup & Recovery

| **Practice** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Scheduled Backups | Automate daily database and `moodledata` backups. |
| Off-site Storage | Keep backups in at least one off-site or cloud location. |
| Test Restores | Regularly perform test restores to ensure data integrity. |
| Backup Logs | Maintain logs of all backup and restore operations. |
| Retention Policy | Define clear retention rules for course and site backups. |

> Refer to [`docs/guides/backup.md`](./backup.md) for detailed procedures.

---

## 👥 6. User Management

| **Area** | **Best Practice** |
|-----------|------------------|
| Enrollment | Automate enrollments using HRIS or CSV imports. |
| Roles & Permissions | Use default roles when possible; document all custom roles. |
| Suspended Accounts | Regularly suspend inactive users instead of deleting them. |
| Privacy & GDPR | Use Moodle’s privacy tools to handle user data requests. |
| User Support | Provide FAQs or a support forum for login and course access issues. |

---

## 🧱 7. Course & Category Organization

| **Aspect** | **Best Practice** |
|-------------|------------------|
| Naming Conventions | Adopt consistent course and category naming (e.g., `2025_Q1_Leadership101`). |
| Archiving | Archive completed courses instead of deleting them. |
| Templates | Provide standardized templates for new courses. |
| Access Dates | Use start and end dates to automate visibility. |
| Quality Review | Periodically review course layouts and usability. |

---

## 📊 8. Monitoring & Reporting

| **Task** | **Frequency** | **Tools / Area** |
|-----------|--------------:|------------------|
| Check Cron Execution | Daily | Site administration → Notifications |
| Review Logs & Reports | Weekly | Reports → Logs, Config changes |
| Check Disk Space | Weekly | Server monitoring tool |
| Track Login Activity | Monthly | Site reports or analytics plugin |
| Review Course Completion Data | Monthly | Completion reports |
| Performance Health Check | Quarterly | Server metrics + Moodle benchmarking tools |

## 🧰 9. Maintenance Workflow

**Recommended workflow for ongoing administration:**

1. **Maintenance window planning** – Announce maintenance in advance using Moodle's notification banner.  
2. **Backup first** – Always back up database and `moodledata` before upgrades or large imports.  
3. **Apply changes in staging** – Test all updates on a test instance before production.  
4. **Deploy during low-usage hours** – Schedule updates during off-peak periods.  
5. **Verify after deployment** – Check key functionalities: login, course access, quiz attempts, gradebook.  
6. **Document everything** – Update change logs, plugin versions, and admin notes.  

---

## 🔎 10. Communication & Collaboration

| **Area** | **Recommendation** |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Admin Collaboration | Use shared channels (e.g., Slack, Teams) to coordinate with co-admins. |
| Change Approval | Implement a change approval workflow for critical actions. |
| User Feedback | Regularly collect feedback from teachers and learners. |
| Transparency | Communicate major updates and new features to all users. |
